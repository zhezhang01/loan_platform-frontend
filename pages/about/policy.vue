        ><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Private money loans – or simply private money – is a term used to describe a loan that is given to an individual or company by a private organization or even a wealthy individual. The organization or the individual is known as a private money lender.

          >2.Is private loan legal?</span
        ><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's perfectly legal for organizations other than banks and credit unions to lend money. However, private lenders still have to comply with the usury laws and banking laws of the states in which they operate.<br />

          >3.Why You Need a Loan Agreement?</span
        ><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you lend anyone any money or provide services without payment, it is important to know if you need to have a loan agreement in place to protect you. You never really want to loan out any money, goods, or services without having a loan agreement in place to ensure that you will be repaid or that you can take legal action in order to have your money recouped. The purpose of a loan agreement is to detail what is being loaned and when the borrower has to pay it back as well as how. The loan agreement has specific terms that detail exactly what is given and what is expected in return. Once it has been executed, it is essentially a promise to pay from the lender to the borrower.

          >4.The Basic Information Needed</span
        ><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every loan agreement, you need to have some basic information that is used to identify the parties that are agreeing to the terms. You will have a section that details who the borrower is and who the lender is. In the borrower's section, you will need to include all of the borrower's information. If they are an individual, this includes their full legal name. If they are not an individual but a business, you will need to include the business or entity designation, which must include "LLC" or "Inc." in the name in order to provide detailed information. You will also need to include their full address. If there is more than one borrower, you should include the information of both on the loan agreement. The lender, sometimes also called the holder, is the person or business that will be providing the goods, money, or services to the borrower once the agreement has been agreed to and signed. Just like you included the borrower's information, you will need to include the lender's information with just as much detail.

          >5.Other legal terms to consider</span
        ><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All loan agreements must specify general terms that define the legal obligations of each party. For instance, the terms regarding repayment schedule, default or contract breach, interest rate, loan security, as well as collateral offered must be clearly outlined.
